##Files Included
The html file is located on the same level as this README, along with a common license.
The CSS file and relevent images can be found in the 'assets' folder

##Changes Made
This website's html originally lacked proper syntax. As such all unspecified areas were renamed and the relevant tags in the style sheet were adjusted to match. The image sections also lacked placeholder names, which were added.
In addition the style sheet itself was poorly formatted. Often certain sections were not grouped together, making the file less accessable to other developers. This was changed and now the section formating and relevent classes flow better.
